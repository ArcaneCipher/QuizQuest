# LHL Midterm Project: QuizQuest

Here are notes related to the LHL midterm group project. This app is a collaborative project showcasing the group work and programming skills of the Lighthouse Labs student team. The team has chosen to work on the Quiz App. An app that lets you create quizzes and share them between friends. The creator of the quiz can view and share all the results at the end of the quiz.

## About the Learning

The midterm project is an evaluated project designed to prepare learners for job readiness by addressing the hard and soft skills needed to be successful on the job.

Hard skills are defined by the technical skills learners acquired in modules 1 through 5. For job readiness purposes, the project shifts away from the fully defined projects learners have been doing in the previous modules and instead requires learners to apply their learning from those modules into a project-based learning opportunity.

The soft skills are defined by the job readiness skills needed of a web developer in role. The midterm will simulate a working environment by providing supports and structure similar to on the job with communication, collaboration, and project management emphasized. Learners will have the opportunity to work collaboratively in a group setting, whilst developing the individual soft skills needed to be successful as a web developer in role, beyond their technical skillset, all whilst being supported by an instructor acting as the work manager.

## About the Midterm Project

In this project, learners will:

- Build a web app from start to finish using the tech and approaches learned to date
- Turn requirements into a working product
- Practice architecting an app in terms of UI/UX, Routes/API and Database
- Manage a multi-developer project with git
- Simulate the working world where you do not always get to select your team, stack or product features
- Collaborate, communicate, project manage
- Simulate on the job structures and supports
- Practice demoing an app in a presentation to help prepare for the final project and employer interviews

[Top](#table-of-contents)

## Project Outcomes

In completing this project, learners will be able to:

- Use git best practices (sans rebase) when working on a project with multiple members (branching, merging, and doing those often) as well as the github workflow (pull requests).
- Use the major steps of software development to execute the project; user stories, wireframes, ERD, Routes, etc.
- Collaborate with team members to decide how to break out the work, set good team structure, and dynamic.
- Engage in a simulated on the job environment
- Prepare and plan how to tailor communication and presentation approach for a technical and non-technical audience
- Present a web development project to a technical and non-technical audience

## Workflow (Git)

### **Team Collaboration Workflow for GitHub and VSCode**

This workflow ensures that everyone stays in sync and reduces the risk of conflicts, enabling your team to collaborate smoothly.

#### **Initial Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   - If you havenâ€™t already, clone the repository to your local machine.

     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:ArcaneCipher/QuizQuest.git
     cd QuizQuest
     ```

   - Open the project folder in VSCode.

2. **Set Up the Upstream Remote:**

   - Ensure your local repo is linked to the main repository (upstream).

     ```bash
     git remote add upstream git@github.com:ArcaneCipher/QuizQuest.git
     ```

   - Check remotes:

     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```

3. **Install Optional Extensions:**

   - Install the **GitLens** and **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** extensions in VSCode for better Git integration and visualization.

[Workflow Top](#table-of-contents)

---

#### **Starting Your Dayâ€™s Work**

1. **Pull the Latest Changes:**

   - Before starting work, ensure your local main branch is up-to-date.

     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull upstream main
     ```

   - This syncs your local `main` branch with the main repository on GitHub.

2. **Create a Feature Branch:**

   - Always create a new branch for the task/feature youâ€™re working on.

     ```bash
     git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>
     ```

   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/quiz-sharing` or `fix/question-ordering`).

[Workflow Top](#table-of-contents)

---

#### **Working on Your Feature Branch**

1. **Make Commits:**

   - Write meaningful commit messages for every change you make.

     ```bash
     git add <file>
     git commit -m "Add feature to share quizzes"
     ```

   - Commit often, but ensure each commit represents a logical unit of work.

2. **Push Your Branch to GitHub:**

   - Push your feature branch to the repository so others can see your work.

     ```bash
     git push origin <feature-branch-name>
     ```

[Workflow Top](#table-of-contents)

---

#### **Collaborating with the Team**

1. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**

   - Once your feature is complete, create a pull request from GitHub:
     - Go to the repository â†’ Click "Pull Requests" â†’ Click "New Pull Request."
   - Assign reviewers and add a description of the changes.

2. **Review and Test:**

   - Review each other's PRs for code quality and functionality.
   - Approve or suggest changes before merging.

3. **Sync Frequently:**

   - If others are pushing changes to the `main` branch, sync your branch regularly:

     ```bash
     git fetch upstream git merge upstream/main
     ```

   - Resolve any conflicts locally before pushing updates to your feature branch.

[Workflow Top](#table-of-contents)

---

#### **Merging and Resolving Conflicts**

1. **Merge the PR:**

   - After approval, merge the pull request on GitHub.

2. **Handle Merge Conflicts:**

   - If conflicts arise during merging:
     - VSCode highlights conflicts in the editor.
     - Choose which changes to keep or manually edit the files.
   - After resolving, mark the conflicts as resolved:

     ```bash
     git add <file>
     git commit
     ```

   - Push the resolved branch:

     ```bash
     git push origin <feature-branch-name>
     ```

[Workflow Top](#table-of-contents)

---

#### **End-of-Day Practices**

1. **Clean Up:**

   - Delete merged branches both locally and remotely to keep things organized.

     ```bash
     git branch -d <feature-branch-name>
     git push origin --delete <feature-branch-name>
     ```

2. **Document Changes:**

   - Update any relevant documentation or comments to reflect the dayâ€™s work.

[Workflow Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Tips for Success**

- **Branch Naming Convention:** Use prefixes like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, or `hotfix/` for clarity.
- **Commit Messages:** Use present-tense and descriptive messages (e.g., "Add functionality for quiz scoring").
- **Pull Requests:** Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix for easier review.
- **Sync Often:** Regularly pull from `main` to avoid large conflicts.
- **Communication:** Use comments in GitHub or a team communication tool (like Slack) to clarify questions or decisions.
- **Backup Work:** If youâ€™re working on an experimental branch, push it to GitHub as a draft for safety.
